# Button CTAs - Sass

This is an example of a Sass stylesheet that I wrote for displaying a buttons.

**I hope to show the following in this example:**

- Well organized, commented and easy to understand styles.
- Use of more advanced CSS and Sass features such as mixins, variables, flexbox, media queries (mobile-first), transitions, etc.
- Use of the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) (block, element, modifier) methodology for class naming convention, complete with modifier styles. This stylesheet shows modifiers for button styles as well as button styles within a specific dark mode wrapper.
- [Order by type](https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/) css property grouping for consistency and clarity.
