# VirtualSupport - Typescript

The `VirtualSupport` component is a small component that acts like an accordion. It was designed to have a button that, when clicked, opens up a series of `InfoButton` links.

This component uses a handful of MUI based components, the Next.js `Link` component, and some custom components.
