# Header - React Typescript

This is the main header component used on every page of the site. It was designed to have 3 rows; the first containing various menus, the second containing the logo, search bar, and a few other links, and the third containing the primary menu. At mobile, the header changes so that the search bar and menus hidden within drawers that can be toggled open via icon buttons.

This header component uses a handful of MUI based components and custom components. The header is sticky to the top of the page via the MUI `AppBar` component. The menus are restyled via the `HeaderMenuStyles` stylesheet.
