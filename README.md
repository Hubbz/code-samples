## Introduction

This repo is a collection of small code samples taken from larger project. These are meant to be used as a reference for my coding style and ability.

Each folder contains a README.md file that explains the code and how it was used in the project. I've also included comments throughout the code to explain what is happening.

**I've removed any sensitive or proprietary information from the code.**

## Live Projects

While I'm not able to share the live client projects that I've worked on, I can speak to some of the internal work I've done at Acro Media.

### // [**Acro Media**](https://www.acromedia.com/)

I've helped build the last 2 iterations of Acro Media's own website. The current version is a decoupled React/Next.js frontend with a Drupal backend. The Drupal backend includes a fully configured suite of Paragraphs for maximum flexibility for the content creators. We matched these paragraphs 1-to-1 to React components to render the frontend. Everything you see on the page is editable.

I was involved in all aspects of this projects except for design. My primary contributions were configuring the backend, helping to build the design system component library, and helping map the JSON API to the components in Next.js. I also migrated the previous Google Tag Manager/Analytics setup to work with the decoupled frontend while upgrading Analytics to GA4. After the site launched, I've continued to maintain it and add new features.

### // [**Urban Hipster - Drupal Comemerce Demo**](https://commerceplus.acromedia.com/)

Urban Hipster is a fully functional ecommerce demo site that I built to help Acro Media's sales team promote Drupal and Drupal Commerce. It includes a variety of product types, cart, checkout flow, etc.

One product, [the UH Axe](https://commerceplus.acromedia.com/product/uh-axe), showcases a very customized product page. As you scroll down and customize options, the add-to-cart form updates in real time so that your customizations are shows accurately once you reach the form.

Another fun feature that I enjoyed building is the blue, radiating feature icons. These are Drupal blocks that get assigned to elements selectors in the page. If the block is assigned to a page and that selector is present, the block is rendered attached to that selector. Clicking on a feature icon opens a dialog with a feature video. I'm actually the narrator of those videos.
